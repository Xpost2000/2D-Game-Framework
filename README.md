former hg repo, dump up here for some reason. Can probably be used to make games in C, autohotreloadable goodness or something.

I kinda just have this here cause it's sort of cool, but I don't actually use this since it's not architected super well. Or at least
I don't really like the way it's architected now. I'd rather just stick to more purpose-built "engines" atm. incomplete but good
enough for game jams actually (free hotreloadable assets, console, rendering with shaders, and some basic sound and crossplatform
browser target stuff... so yeah)

because I don't particularly care about this, uh you can figure out how to build it on your own. sorry
